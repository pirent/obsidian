# OOP Design Principle
Created: 2022-07-02 16:35

## Good way to apply
**SRP** while creating class, method or any module (even SQL store procedure, function). 👉 It make code more readable, robust and testable.

🤷‍♂️ Can't follow **DIP** everytime, sometime have to depend on concrete class. Only thing we have to do is understanding requirement properly to find area where **DIP** should be followed.

Follow **DIP & SRP** will open the door for **OCP**.

Create specific interface so that complexity and confusion will be kept away and **ISP** will not get violated.

While using inheritance take care of **LSP**.
